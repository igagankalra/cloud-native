# Introduction to Cloud Native Fundamentals 

__Cloud-native__ refers to the set of practices that empowers an organization to __build and manage applications at scale__

__Containers__ are used to run a single application with all required dependencies. The main characteristics of containers are: easy to manage, deploy, and fast to recover.

__Microservices__ are used to manage and configure a collection of small independent services that can be easily packaged and executed within a container.

# CNCF and Cloud-Native Tooling

CNCF was founded in 2015, and it provides a vendor-neutral home to open source projects such as Kubernetes, Prometheus, ETCD, Envoy and many more. 

__Kubernetes__ is a container orchestrator that is capable to solutionize the integration of the following functionalities:
- Runtime
- Networking
- Storage
- Service Mesh
- Logs and metrics
- Tracing

# Stakeholders
From a __business perspective__, the adoption of cloud-native-tooling represents:
- Agility - perform strategic transformations
- Growth - quickly iterate on customer feedback
- Service availability - ensure the product is available to customers 24/7

From a __technical perspective__ the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:
- Automation - release a service without human intervention
- Orchestration - introduce a container orchestration to manage thousands of services with minimal efford
- Observability - ability to independently troubleshoot and debug each component
